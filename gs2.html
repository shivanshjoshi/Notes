  <button type="button" class="collapsible">1. Indian Constitution</button>
    <div class="content">
      <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Contempt of Court: Arbitrary use of the powers by the courts eg: Prashant Bhushan.<br>
              Situation in other countries: England(From where it originated) recommendation to remove COC, obsolete in foreign democracies like Canada and US<br>
                             Eg: England press called judge Old fool( Judge replied I am old but fool is others perception) and Enemies of public in Brexit case, in bath situation Judiciary avoided the use of COC.<br>
              Problem in India: Wide field for coc and suo moto power, even after 2006 amendment for good faith. It is loosing public faith and confidence, no test for contempt, restricting rt to speak, silencing the critic, not taking lightly( court and judges can have wide shoulders to shrug off few comments)

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">2. Federal Structure</button>
    <div class="content">
      <ol>
          <li>
          <p>Ladakh: Under staff departments, confusion over recruitment and opacity over governance. Demand for PSC for the UT. 
                   Essential departments are without any heads and even are understaffed i.e: Doctors, Agriculture, Education, Food control, Disaster management.
          </p> </li>
          <li>
          <p>J&K: Lieutenant-Governor appointed: Manoj Sinha; Ex-LG: Murmu (1st LG of J&K Union territory) now appointed as CAG(art 148,149)
          </p> </li>
          <li>
          <p>Nationalism and Crisis of Federalism:
         3 Types of Nationalism - 1930's <br>
              1. Cultural or Ethno-Religious: Hindu- Muslim, Bifurcation of Muslim league and Hindu Mahasabha. Sense of being from one religion overweight their mother tongue and place. -> Prevail after Partition <br>
              2. Civic: Based on common struggle in history against British -> Constitution adopted with this federal structure <br>
              3. Coalescent with Linguistic federalism: Regional, territorial distinct from others but of same state/ place along with lingustic federal. -> Thought to lead to Break ups in new and fragile India. <br>
         1953's: <br>
              Linguistic states focus of popular agitation -> Creation of Andra pradesh => Looks after all major linguistic group, Administration was easy, deepens democracy and alleviates anxiety of regional minorities <br>
         1956: Coalescent seems helpful and effective for democray: <br>
              1953 states reorganised -> India coelescent nation state. From "Holding together" to "Coming Together"<br>
         Benefits of Coelescent: Created strong regional parties -> Centre now more focused towards them and Centre-state relation improved -> Treating all states similar.

              <p>Higer Education<br>
                 3 Ideal learning outcome:<br>
                 - Provide knowledge in relevant learning discipline<br>
                 - Education impart student with skills needed for their jobs/enterprises.<br>
                 - Students are expected to play a constructive role in shaping the society and world at large using values and ideals of modern, progressive society.<br>
                Problems:<br>
                There is a huge gulf between the curriculum and job requirement.<br>
                Pressure on the institute to complete the syllabus(outdated) in limited time frame.<br>
                Lack of actual internship programs.<br>
                Way Forward:<br>
                Updating/ re-evaluate the syllabus regularly with the job requirement in current market.<br>
                Combing evaluation of curriculum along with industrial internship to develop the skill set.<br>
                Light home based proctored exams, time saved by students by not attending classes can be compensated by spending time on development of skills and prosocial attitude.<br>
                Use of videos, films and books to guide the students in this manner must be promoted.<br>
                The demographic strength of the country must be utilised to fullest or else it will become liability.<br>
