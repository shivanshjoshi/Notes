<p>Notes:</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">1. Indian Constitution</button>
<div class="content">
  <ol>
    <li>
    <p>Contempt of Court: Arbitrary use of the powers by the courts eg: Prashant Bhushan.<br>
          Situation in other countries: England(From where it originated) recommendation to remove COC, obsolete in foreign democracies like Canada and US<br>
                         Eg: England press called judge Old fool( Judge replied I am old but fool is others perception) and Enemies of public in Brexit case, in bath situation Judiciary avoided the use of COC.<br>
          Problem in India: Wide field for coc and suo moto power, even after 2006 amendment for good faith. It is loosing public faith and confidence, no test for contempt, restricting rt to speak, silencing the critic, not taking lightly( court and judges can have wide shoulders to shrug off few comments)
